          I would learn about different types of sensors the following week.
          Initially, I had no intent in building a prototype for my physics
          class at all and it was not required. However, my partner told me to
          do something for extra credit, and she came up with utilizing light
          sensors for LEDs.

            After that, we bought some basic components such as LEDS, resistors,
            wires, a battery, and a light sensor. Then, we sought advice from a
            STEM teacher and told him about our project. After a while of
            discussion, we realized we did not fully understand the principle of
            the light sensor. The sensor conducts electricity when there is
            light shining on it, which at first sounded the opposite of what we
            thought. After that, he took out a component called a transistor,
            drew a simple transistor-light sensor circuit diagram and explained
            thoroughly about how a transistor works and how it inverted the
            light sensor principle, so it worked to our advantage. He later gave
            us a breadboard to test and build circuits more easily.

            It was an enlightening session with him, and then my partner had
            another idea. She insisted on building a streetlamp model since we
            had bought so many LEDS. I was really excited to see my Physics
            teacher reaction because making an experimental product for a class
            lesson was not a common thing to do among students, so my teacher
            would definitely so surprised.

            Seeing the transistor and light sensor in action and building the
            circuit utilizing their principles were amazing experiences. It also
            helped me memorize the knowledge better since hands-on practice
            helps students in understanding principles and physics effect
            better!

            You can see how hyped I was when I was experimenting with the light
            sensor. I also later discovered that since the sensor was small, it
            needed super close and bright light source for it to work.
