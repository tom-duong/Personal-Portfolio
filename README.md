# Personal Portfolio V0

Welcome to my digital portfolio! This is the place where I showcase my projects and my thoughts about them. I built this website with HTML, CSS and few Bootstrap elements. I learned to build a website a few years back and did not have much opportunities to make it useful for me. It is such an enjoyable experience to recall some memories during the portfolio design and development process.
