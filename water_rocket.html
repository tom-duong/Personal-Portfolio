          Specifically, the competition scoring system was the rocket that had
          the longest time in the air won and it needed to land in the
          designated area. The water rocket was required to have a parachute as
          well. A water rocket is a simple model rocket that uses pressurized
          air to expel water for propulsion.

            We started with finding what type of bottle to use for the body of
            the rocket. Preferably, it should be a 1.5L bottle. We gathered
            multiple of different soft drinks brand bottle but nothing beated an
            Aquafina bottle. It was because the bottle mouth fitted the pipe of
            the launch pad just enough, so it was not too tight or too loose.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the second part, we built the launch pad which was basically made
            of pvc pipes and an air valve. We based it on the example model that
            an instructor had shown us. The hard part was keeping the middle
            upward pipe straight when we glued it.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the third part, we worked on the fins, the heads of the rocket,
            parachute deployment mechanism and the type of material for the
            parachute. The head of the rocket was the hardest for us. <br />
            In terms of the parachute, we used plastic bags since it was
            lightweight, and common to be used as a parachute for other toys
            too. However, upon testing, plastic bag was unable to be deployed
            properly and ripped. It seemed like strong wind high up blew so
            hard. We ended up with a piece of cloth for the parachute, followed
            by folding it properly so it could deploy successfully.

            We knew the head needed to be pointy for sure. We relied on the air
            resistance to lift off the head. A bottle upper part, a cone shaped
            folded paper head was implemented but it either came off before the
            rocket reached maximum height or was attached to the rocket too
            tightly. They were inconsistent in the chance of deploying the
            parachute.

            Fortunately, one time after class, I sat near a trash can and saw
            plastic cups and I realized those cups head had a potential. I
            instantly came up with the idea of cutting the plastic cup head out,
            sticking it upside down to the head of the rocket, and resting the
            bottle head on the edge of the cup head. It solved the problem where
            when the rocket was shot into the air, the head was pushed down so
            it was attached too tightly with the rocket. Now, it was tight
            enough so that it would not leave the rocket until maximum height
            and loose enough to pop out easily for the parachute to be deployed!

            At the end, we got first prize! To be honest, I could not have done
            these without my teammates even if I had had a breakthrough idea.
            They helped me in testing, recording the rocket performance for each
            design, getting the materials to test with and most important of
            all, boosting my confidence!

            As you can see in the video down below, I was the one who was
            kneeling down, holding the launching station, and when the rocket
            landed inside the allowed area. My team were overjoyed!
